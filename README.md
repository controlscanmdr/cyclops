# Cyclops

# NOTE: This project is no longer actively maintained

Cyclops is a single-page application (SPA) that displays real-time data from an instance of [Cyphon](https://dunbarcyber.github.io/cyphon/). Built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Cyclops allows you to easily view, assign, and investigate Cyphon alerts. It provides an “eye” into your data, enabling you to respond to issues quickly and effectively.
